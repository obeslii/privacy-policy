  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>App Name:</strong> MorpheusAI<br>
  <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 16, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>MorpheusAI collects the text you voluntarily provide, including your dream descriptions, selected emotions, and optional life context. This information is processed to generate an AI-based interpretation.</p>
  <p>If you use the "Save" feature, the generated dream title and interpretation are stored in a private, local database on your device. This data is accessible only by you through the app's "History" screen.</p>
  <p>No other personal information (such as your name, email address, or location) is collected or stored by the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The text you enter (dream, emotion, context) is sent to the OpenAI API solely for the purpose of generating an interpretation.</li>
    <li>Saved dream data is stored locally on your device for you to access later. This data is <strong>not</strong> transmitted to our servers or any third party.</li>
    <li>We do not permanently store or log your dream entries on any external servers after they are processed by the API.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> Your dream-related text is sent to OpenAI's system for analysis and interpretation generation. OpenAI's own privacy policy applies to this data during processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> The app uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may use device identifiers to serve personalized ads. You can learn more about how Google handles data here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All communications with external services (OpenAI, AdMob) are transmitted securely using HTTPS. Data saved on your device is stored in the app's private local storage, which is not accessible by other applications.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>You can delete your saved dreams from within the app's "History" screen at any time. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data, including your saved dreams, will be permanently deleted from your device.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
